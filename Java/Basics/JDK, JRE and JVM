## JDK -

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a cross-platformed software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java-based software applications and applets. It is a core package used in Java, along with the [**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/) and the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). 

**JDK contains:**

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
- An interpreter/loader (Java),
- A compiler (javac),
- An archiver (jar) and many more.

## How JVM Works – JVM Architecture?

JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications. JVM is the one that actually calls the **main** method present in a Java code. JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).

Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.

When we compile a *.java* file, *.class* files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in *.java* file are generated by the Java compiler. This *.class* file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM.

# Differences between JDK, JRE and JVM

**1. JDK** (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to **develop and execute(run)** the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things

- Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
- JRE (to execute your java program).

**2. JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to **only run(not develop)** the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.

**3. [JVM (Java Virtual Machine)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/)** is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an [**i*nterpreter*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/).**
